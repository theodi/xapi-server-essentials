## Overview

The ODI Maturity Assessment Tool is designed to support organisations in understanding their current capabilities in managing and utilising data. By using this tool, organisations can assess their maturity levels, identify areas for improvement, and track progress over time.

## Features

- **Interactive Assessments**: Users can interact with assessments to evaluate their organisation's maturity.
- **Progress Tracking**: Track progress over time and view historical assessments.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generate detailed reports that summarise the assessment results and provide actionable insights.
- **AI-Powered Summaries**: Automatically generate human-readable summaries for each activity, dimension, and an executive overview using advanced AI capabilities.
- **Customisable Assessments**: Upcoming features will allow for more customisation in assessments and evaluation criteria.

## AI-Powered Summaries

### Activity Summaries
For each activity within an assessment, the tool generates an AI-driven summary. These summaries highlight areas where the organisation has shown progress and suggest improvements needed to reach the next level of maturity. This feature helps users quickly understand their current standing without diving into the detailed responses.

### Dimension Summaries
The AI also provides summaries for each dimension within the assessment. These summaries aggregate the insights from individual activities, offering a broader perspective on how the organisation performs across a particular domain.

### Executive Summary
At the top level, the tool generates an executive summary. This overview distills the key findings from all dimensions into a cohesive narrative, offering high-level recommendations and insights for strategic decision-making.

## Available Assessments

### 1. Open Data Maturity Model
This model assesses an organisation's maturity in publishing and using open data. It helps organisations understand where they are on their open data journey and what steps they need to take to progress.

### 2. Data Ethics Maturity Model (Coming Soon)
This model will help organisations assess their maturity in handling data ethically, ensuring that data practices are aligned with ethical standards.

### 3. Data Practices Maturity Model
This assessment will evaluate an organisation's data practices across key areas of data governance and management.
